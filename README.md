## Task Description

## Introduction
Scene understanding is one of the critical milestones of computer vision, allowing the definition and classification of the context from images, as a foundation for further object recognition within the context. The scene classification competition track invites the computer vision community and researchers to develop new algorithms and models that improve the state-of-the-art in visual scene understanding. The task requires assigning labels to images indicating different scenes and places.

In this competition, we provide 80,000+ images comprising 80 unique scene categories, such as airport terminal, football field. Each category contains between 600 and 1100 images, and the images were carefully selected from a database of 4 million images. Contestants are expected to develop a algorithm that will produce a list of 3 scene categories in descending order of confidence for each image. The quality of a label will be evaluated based on the label that best matches the ground truth label for the image. The details of scene categories is shown in the table, which contains scene category label id, corresponding Chinese label, and English label. [1][2][3]
